# Distance-Calculator-Using-IoT
This project was designed to calculate distance. A Buzzer, Arduino Uno and Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 and  is used here to measure distance in range of 2cm-400cm. Whenever an object crosses the given range, the led blinks and the buzzer starts producing sound.
